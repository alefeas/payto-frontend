feat: auto-fill concept and service dates for associated credit/debit notes

- Auto-complete concept when selecting associated invoice
- Auto-complete service dates when selecting associated invoice
- Disable concept field when invoice is associated (inherited from invoice)
- Show service date fields only when concept requires them (services/products_services)
- Disable service date fields when invoice is associated (inherited from invoice)
- Add validation for required service dates
- Include concept and service dates in payload
- Improve UX with helpful messages about inherited fields

AFIP compliance:
- Service dates are required for services and products_services concepts
- Credit/debit notes must maintain same concept and service dates as original invoice

UX improvements:
- Less manual data entry (concept and dates auto-filled)
- Clear visual feedback (disabled fields with explanation)
- Conditional field visibility (service dates only when needed)
- Robust validation with specific error messages
